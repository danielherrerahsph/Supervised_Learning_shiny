## Supervised Learning Shiny
The goal of the shiny app is to create a dashboard that allows users to  easily perform and assess different supervised learning modeling techniques. This app allows users to upload their own datasets, check that the outcome variable is binary, and perform appropriate classification machine learning models. Within each method, where intuitive, there are options for adjusting hyperparameters. 

The results for each tab (modeling technique) are a table with accuracy and other diagnostic tools for model comparison. As well, an ROC curve is created to visualize the effectiveness.  

Currently, this dashboard allows for logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, and decision trees. 

For future additions, I would like to be able to include a method of kfold cross validation. Additionally, more flexibility in the data uploading process, including but not limited to handling different file types and specificing column data types, would improve the general usability of this dashboard.

The app can currenlty be accessed at: https://danielherrera1500.shinyapps.io/Supervised_Learning_shiny/
